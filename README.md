# Flickd

Flickd is an iOS app that you can use to decide what movie you want to watch. 

<h3>Background info</h3>
I watch a lot of movies and I use <a href="https://letterboxd.com/marycos/">Letterboxd</a> to log, rate and keep track of them all. My current Letterboxd <a href="https://letterboxd.com/marycos/watchlist/">watchlist</a> has 76 movies in it and I can assure you it's going to continue to grow. I am indecisive so picking a movie to watch from my watchlist often is a long drawn out task. I wanted to make an iOS app that will make that decision for me. Users can also input the link of a list on letterboxd as well if they're looking to decide from there

<h3>APIs used in this application</h3>
- <a href="https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire">Alamofire</a> <br>
- <a href="https://github.com/tid-kijyun/Kanna">Kanna</a> <br>
- <a href="https://github.com/gkye/TheMovieDatabaseSwiftWrapper">The Movie Database Swift Wrapper</a> <br>
- <a href="https://github.com/kean/Nuke">Nuke</a> <br>

<h3>Running the application</h3>
When running this app, all you have to do is clone the app and then open "pickAFlick.xcworkspace". Then you can run the application on either the XCode simulator or an iPhone.

<h3>Example link to input on the app</h3>
Here is a letterboxd <a href="https://letterboxd.com/marycos/list/movies-by-women/">list</a> that you can use to try out the app if you are not familiar with Letterboxd.

<h3>Future Improvements in the App</h3>
- Make the input box so the user only has to input the list name and the username of the person who created it
- Some lists extend into multiple pages
- Add a button so users can flag when incorrect data (poster or synopsis) is pulled from The Movie Database API
- When Letterboxd makes their API public, implement their API instead of using so many different APIs
